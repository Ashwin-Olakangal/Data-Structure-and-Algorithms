# Stack as an abstarct data type:
    A list with the restriction that insertion and
    deletion can be performed only from one end, the top.

=> stack is LiFo: The latest(last) item to be inserted the
    is the firt item to be removed.

# Operations:
    Push(x): An insertion of item on top of stack
    Pop(): Removes the most recent items on top of stack
    Top(): returns the topmost item on the stack
    IsEmpty(): returns true if the stack is empty

    => We can push or pop only one element at a time
    => All these operations can be performed in constant time

stack can be visualised as a jar which is only open from the top

Applications:
    - function calls/recursion
    - implement undo operation in a text editor
    - balanced parenthesis(checked by compiler)
